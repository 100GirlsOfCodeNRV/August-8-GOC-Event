						<h2>Casey Haycocks</h2>
						<p id="small">From Winchester, Va. Played volleyball and was in DECA in High School, which got me interested in marketing. Majored in Marketing Management at Virginia Tech. I love marketing because it’s so vast. You must use all parts of a business along with analytics to decide how to present your product and to which audience – which can all be backed up with analytics! I love Mill Mountain coffee, Papa Johns, Hokie football and cats.</p>

						<h2>Karen Laiacona</h2>
						<p>kplaiacona@gmail.com</p>
						<p id="small">Hi, I’m Karen. I’m 23 years old and am a Virginia Tech alum. My degree was in Communication, but I pursued a career in content development. I had some experience from attempting websites before, but committing to a full time job is a big deal. I was confident I could learn quickly because of the countless times I’ve tried new things in the past. It’s important to know yourself, and the rest will fall into place.</p>
